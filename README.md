Document ORM implements data mapping from plain python objects into tables hosted on SQL Server 2016 (and beyond) databases. Is a "hybrid" mapper because besides supporting RBDMS storage it has capabilities of storing entire collections of objects or "non-generic" fields into text columns on JSON format (NoSQL approach).
