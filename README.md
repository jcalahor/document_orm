Document ORM implements data mapping from plain python objects into tables hosted on SQL Server 2016 (and beyond) databases. Is a "hybrid" mapper because besides supporting RDBMS storage it has NoSQL capabilities such as storing collections of objects in a single column (JSON collection) or a list of columns in a single JSON column (JSON property value)
